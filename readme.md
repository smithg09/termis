## Requirements

* iTerm2 Version 3.3 or later
* Python 3.5 or later

## Installation

Make sure that you are running Python 3.5 or later

```shell
pip install termis
```

[Enable Python API usage](./.github/assets/iterm_settings.png) in iTerm settings.

```shell
termis --version
```

## Example
The layout, number of panes, tabs, titles and commands is configurable and is detailed below.

![](./.github/assets/demo.gif)

## Usage
Open iTerm and simply run the below command

```shell
termis -c config.yml
```
If you don't provide `-c` flag, termis will look for `termis.yml` file in the current directory and use that.

Here is the list of options available:

```shell
termis [-c,--config <config-file>]  # Path to the configuration file
        [-h,--help]                  # Shows the help screen
        [-v,--version]               # Shows the installed termis version
        [-n,--new]                   # Runs termis in a new window
        [-p,--profile <name>]        # Use a profile from ~/.termis/profiles
        [-w,--wizard]                # Run interactive configuration wizard
        [-d,--dry-run]               # Show what would happen without executing
        [-l,--log-level <level>]     # Set logging level (debug, info, warning, error)
        [-s,--save-global <name>]    # Save current configuration to global profiles
        [-g,--global-list]           # List all available global profiles
        [-t,--tools-check]           # Check availability of development tools
```

## Configuration
Configuration file to set up the sessions has the format below

```yml
profile: "Default"

| `focus`       | Pane to be in focus when termis is finished. `focus: true`. There should only be one focus flag per Tab. If multiple are found, it will focus on the last pane evaluated.                                                                       |

## Layouts
The parameter `position` in each pane decides where each of the window panes will be displayed. The position value has the format below

```shell
x / y / z ‚Äì both x and y are required parameters

x: refers to the column in the window
y: refers to the row of the given column x
z: refers to the column in given row column x+y (used for complex layout structure)
```

Here are some of the examples for different pane layouts

## Single Pane Window

For single pane, since there is one column and one row, the position for pane would be `1/1/1`
```
.------------------.
| 1/1              |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
'------------------'
```
Here is how the configuration would look like
```yml
version: "1.0"
tabs:
  some-project:
    title: "Demo Project"
    panes:
      - title: "Demo Pane"
        position: "1/1/1"
        commands:
          - "yarn dev"
```

## Complex Pane Layout

```
.------------------.------------------.------------------.
| 1/1/1            | 2/1/1            | 3/1/1            |
|                  |                  |                  |
|                  |                  |                  |
|                  |                  |                  |
|                  |                  |------------------|
|--------.---------|                  | 3/2/1            |
|1/2/1   | 1/2/2   |                  |                  |
|        |         |                  |                  |
|        |         |                  |------------------|
|        |         |                  | 3/3/1            |
|        |         |                  |                  |
|        |         |                  |                  |
'--------'---------'------------------'------------------'
```
Configuration for that would be

```yml
tabs:
  complex:
    title: "Complex Layout"
    panes:
      - position: "1/1/1"
      - position: "1/2/1"
      - position: "1/2/2"

      - position: "2/1/1"

      - position: "3/1/1"
      - position: "3/2/1"
      - position: "3/3/1"
```

## Tool Integrations

Termis supports various tool integrations that can be configured per pane:

```yml
panes:
  - position: "1/1"
    tools:
      vscode:
        files: ["file1", "file2"]
      docker:
        # Docker specific configurations
      git:
        # Git specific configurations
```

You can check available tools using:
```shell
termis --tools-check
```
